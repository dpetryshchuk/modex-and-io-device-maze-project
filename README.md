# modex-and-io-device-project 
This was the second machine problem for my OS development class. We worked with a pre-made io device (TUX) with a direction pad and an LED display to navigate a game character through a randomly generated maze that was displayed on our machine emulator using VGA Mode X.

**This project had two focuses: Writing the device driver for the TUX controller and learning to display graphics using VGA Mode-X.**
